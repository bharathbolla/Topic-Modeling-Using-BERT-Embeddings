# Topic-Modeling-Using-Bert-Embeddings
Customers' reviews and comments are important  for businesses to understand users' sentiment about the  products and services. However, this data needs to be analyzed  to assess the sentiment associated with topics/aspects to provide  efficient customer assistance. LDA and LSA fail to capture the  semantic relationship and are not specific to any domain. In  this study, we evaluate BERTopic, a novel method that  generates topics using sentence embeddings on Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) data. Our work shows  that BERTopic is flexible and yet provides meaningful and  diverse topics compared to LDA and LSA. Furthermore,  domain-specific pre-trained embeddings (FinBERT) yield even  better topics. We evaluated the topics on coherence score (c_v)  and UMass.
